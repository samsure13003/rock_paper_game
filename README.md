# rock_paper_game


This Python program is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game that follows these conditions:
1. The game runs for three rounds before asking the player if they want to play again.
2. User input validation ensures only valid choices ("rock," "paper," "scissors") are accepted.
3. A loop handles invalid inputs, ensuring the user enters a valid choice.
4. The game can be replayed based on the userâ€™s response after three rounds.
